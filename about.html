				<h2 id="skip"> Jordan McKay </h2>
				<p> My name is Jordan McKay. I'm a professional experience designer and pianist from Ann Arbor Michigan. I've been acting onstage and playing RPGs since I was introduced to D&amp;D 2e at age 7, and I've participated in countless campaigns as a player and as a DM. I am a collaborative DM, and I love working with players to fill in the gaps in the world and the story. I find that it really helps me to determine what the group vibe is and drives the experience towards something everybody can enjoy. Our campaign is designed to feel like a long-running television drama, complete with cinematographic narration. One effect of this is that we can all participate in designing the best hypothetical show by stepping out of character into director's stance and talking about the "cinematography" and "soundtrack."

				<h2> Previous D&amp;D campaign: Pandossus </h2>
				<p> A long, long time ago, a forgotten bard made a wish. He wished to possess all knowledge. Immediately, the earth shook as an enormous catacomb formed underneath the streets and canals of his bustling city of Pandossus. An interdimensional library appeared, full of every book in existence, future or past, from every possible universe. The city collapsed under its weight, forming a crater in which the surviving citizens would rebuild. 
				</p>
				<p>Thousands of years later, the endless library beneath Pandossus is the foundation of the culture and economy of the city. Elite booksellers compete to acquire the rarest and most valuable tomes. Syndicates of thieves delve into the stacks, retrieving impossible knowledge for the highest bidder. The wizards of the Latharia University send expeditions ever deeper, attempting to harness the power of the catacombs to create interdimensional portals of their own. And when so much knowledge is gathered so close to the boundaries of reality and unreality, even stranger things can happen...
