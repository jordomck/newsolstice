			<h2>
				DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS ON THE SOUTH SEAS! 
			</h2>
			<p>
				<b>New Solstice</b> is a homebrew living-world experience featuring intense action, cinematic collaborative storytelling, complex heists, and exciting political drama. We have been playing this campaign for about 40 sessions so far, and we're excited for our new players to join us as we approach the next major arc of the campaign.
				<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				It's a bright, high-magic setting, but that doesn't mean life is easy! As agents of the scrappy jungle city-state of <b>New Solstice</b>, which recently won its independence from the <b>Larian Empire</b>, it will be up to you to forge new alliances, explore ancient ruins, and protect the Southern continent of <b>Marda</b> from the forces that would threaten it. This is a world where the decisions of the players have the power to change the trajectory of history. We've had a lot of fun with it and we're excited to have you come along too!

			<h2>
				GAME TIME AND ATTENDANCE POLICY
			</h2>
			<p>
				We play more-or-less every week on <b>Friday</b> evenings at <b>7:45 Eastern Time until Midnight</b>, using <b>Discord</b> voice calls and <b>Roll20</b>. We play whenever 3 players and the DM are able to make it, although our expectation is that players attend whenever there is not an unavoidable conflict. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We start promptly on-time and finish at midnight, in order to respect the time of everybody at the table. This policy ensures that games are rarely canceled or rescheduled, and in the 120 weeks the group has been together we've played well over 100 sessions! 
				The game is not streamed or recorded in any way.

			<h2>
				THE STORY SO FAR
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our story began when the jungle port colony of <b>New Solstice</b> was re-absorbed into the <b>Larian Empire</b> that exiled the Solstinians twenty years before. Red-uniformed <b>Sunsetter</b> soldiers occupied the port city, enforcing martial law. Loyalists were rewarded and dissenters were imprisoned and executed. Democracy gave way to fealty and monetary corruption, and traders from the capital of <b>Varenth</b> exported away the magical octarine ore from the <b>Southern Star Mines</b>. From the disgruntled populace of the once-free city of <b>New Solstice</b>, a rebellion formed: the <b>Defiance</b>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the last 40 episodes, our party of adventurers, agents of the <b>Defiance</b>, have been engaged in high-action espionage, collecting intelligence, sabotaging key resources, disrupting defenses, stealing sailing ships, exploring forgotten elven ruins, battling murderous fey, recruiting citizens to the <b>Defiance</b>, training soldiers, slaying Mithral dragons with ship-mounted solar cannons, and clashing with the <b>Eventide Platoon</b>, the band of elite Imperial spies opposing them.

			<h2>
				YOUR ROLE IN THE STORY
			</h2>
			<p>
				 As you join this campaign, you can choose which nation you come from. Perhaps you're from New Solstice, like <b>Kieran, Ariadne, or Levin</b>. Or maybe you're a Drepolitan citizen, like <b>Acroatis the Listener</b>. Or perhaps you're a <b>Sunsetter</b> deserter who leaves the army as the <b>Garrison</b> falls, or you're from somewhere new I haven't thought of yet!
			</p>
			<p>
				 To help you make that decision, I will meet with you personally in Roll20 at your convenience for a mid-campaign session zero. We will make sure that you are engaged with a variety of plotlines and are anchored to the existing party and to the setting itself!

				CURRENT EVENTS: JOURNEY TO DREPOLIS!
			</h2>
			<p>Acroatis, a minotaur soldier from the faraway Greco-Roman republic of Drepolis, arrived bearing a letter:</p>
			<section>
				<p>
				<b>Greetings, leaders of the Independent City-State of New Solstice.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				My name is Quintus Sentius Marcellus, and I am one of the thirty-one Senators of Drepolis. Through the grace of Thoael, my constituents have voted me into this noble office, and I am but a humble messenger of their desires, sending their words across the sea like the manifold songs of Filipos. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Your nation is nascent, fighting for its freedom from Larian oppression. Information from the scouts of the Drepolitan Navy and the Prophets of Ceakrim has made it clear that your efforts are fated to succeed. As an experienced politician and as a politist, I send you this scroll as a warning: the world has noticed New Solstice and will not hesitate to react to the impending freedom of your State. A nation that stands alone has little hope of survival, just as the stubborn guard of Olynthion could not stand against the Gugni without the aid of Stelios Clay-skinned.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the City-State of New Solstice takes its first steps onto the world’s stage, it is critical that relationships with other nations strengthen your new position in the world. As mutual enemies of Varenth and the Larian empire, and as democratic governments, it is the belief of the Politistic Coalition that New Solstice and Drepolis would stand stronger together as allies. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Senate has scheduled debates regarding international treaties as soon as our armies drive the Larian Empire off of the sacred lands of Drepolis. With the blessings of Fael the bright-eyed, we will achieve this goal by Midsummer’s eve. Our Senate humbly requests the presence of the New Solstinian Delegation for these debates. If you choose to honor us with your presence, there is a chance that an alliance may be forged to the mutual benefit of both of our nations. Please dispatch your diplomatic corps at your earliest convenience to ensure that your new nation will not be isolated from the global community of democracy. 
			</p>
			<p>May the scales of Thoael balance your decision. <p> <b>Quintus Sentius Marcellus</b></p></p></section>
			<p>
				This letter will send the party on a journey to the sun-drenched nation of <b>Drepolis</b>, a land of heroes and monsters, myths, schemes, mysteries, wonders, gods, adventures, and good old-fashioned grudges.
